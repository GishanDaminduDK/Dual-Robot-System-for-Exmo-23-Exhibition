# Dual-Robot-System-for-Exmo-23-Exhibition
Largest technological exhibition in Sri Lanka hosted by University of Moratuwa.
ü§ñ Thrilled to showcase our Autonomous Dual Robot System at EXMO 2023!

I am delighted to share that our group had the privilege of representing the EXMO Exhibition at the prestigious University of Moratuwa in 2023.
Our primary robot hosts the secondary, enabling seamless collaboration. They excel in tasks like line & dotted line following, maze solving, color detection, and box grabbing, all through advanced communication.
üìä Our exhibit not only showcased the cutting-edge prowess of our communicable multi-robot system but also highlighted its practical applications across a myriad of industries.
üõ†Ô∏è Precision engineering was at the heart of our project, resulting in robots that effortlessly navigate real-world challenges with a focus on precision and accuracy.
ü§ù EXMO provided us with an invaluable platform to engage with industry experts, peers, and tech enthusiasts. We had the privilege of sharing our insights in electronics, telecommunication, and robotics, all while gaining a deeper understanding of emerging technologies.
üéâ Our dedicated team's relentless effort and passion, combined with the unwavering support from the University of Moratuwa's Department of Electronic and Telecommunication, culminated in this remarkable achievement.
These robots offer an immersive learning experience for students at the intersection of technology and education. Proud to empower the next generation of innovators!
