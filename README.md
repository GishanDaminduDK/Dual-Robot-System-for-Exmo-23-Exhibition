Welcome to the repository for the Autonomous Dual Robot System showcased at EXMO 2023, hosted by the University of Moratuwa! ü§ñ

## Overview

We are thrilled to present our Autonomous Dual Robot System, which was the highlight of the largest technological exhibition in Sri Lanka. Our project, hosted by the University of Moratuwa, features a primary robot that collaborates seamlessly with a secondary robot. These robots excel in various tasks, including:

- Line and dotted line following
- Maze solving
- Color detection
- Box grabbing

All of these tasks are achieved through advanced communication between the robots. üìä

## Cutting-edge Technology and Practical Applications

Our exhibit not only demonstrates the cutting-edge capabilities of our communicable multi-robot system but also highlights its practical applications across diverse industries. üõ†Ô∏è Our project is rooted in precision engineering, resulting in robots that navigate real-world challenges with a focus on precision and accuracy. ü§ù

## Engaging with Experts and Peers

Participating in EXMO 2023 provided us with an invaluable platform to engage with industry experts, peers, and tech enthusiasts. We had the privilege of sharing insights in electronics, telecommunication, and robotics, all while gaining a deeper understanding of emerging technologies. üéâ

## Acknowledgments

This remarkable achievement wouldn't have been possible without the dedication and passion of our team members:
